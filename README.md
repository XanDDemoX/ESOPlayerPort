ESOPlayerPort
=============

Jump to your friends, group and guild members or a (unknown) wayshrine in a zone (via guild members) menu addon and console command for The Elder Scrolls Online (TESO). 

Note: This addon will work best if you are a member of one or more guilds with players in your own faction.

Players must be online to be jumped to and not all players can always be jumped to. Essentially if you can't jump to them from your friends list / group list or guild roster then you can't jump to them with this addon either.

Installation
=============

Place the "PlayerPort" folder in your addons folder:

"Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\Addons"

"Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\liveeu\Addons"

So the end folder structure is as follows:

"Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\Addons\PlayerPort"

"Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\liveeu\Addons\PlayerPort"


Usage
=============

Type into chat / console window:

/goto - opens a menu with travel options

/goto LocationName - attempts to travel to given location name via a player in your guild

/goto PlayerName - attempts to travel to the player with the given account name in your group/friends list/ guild

/goto CharacterName - attempts to travel to the player with the given character name in your group.

Right click on a guild member or friend in chat window to open "Jump to player" menu.
